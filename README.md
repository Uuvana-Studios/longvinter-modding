## Making a Mod
1. Open the Longvinter modding project  
2. Go to `File` &rarr; `Create UGC`
3. Fill in the `Name`, `Author` and `Description` and press `Create Mod`
4. You should now have a new empty folder in the content browser

## Adding a new Item Data Holder
Right click in the empty mod folder and click `Blueprint Class`  

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/be1aa9cc-4722-4b76-89f4-1b8690bd6e62)

Select `A_ItemDataHolder` under the `All Classes` and add it to the mod

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/ed146279-3454-4bfc-8d18-045e561fa28f)

Now add a Replacement Actor Component to the new Item Data Holder so that it can replace the one already in the game

Open the Item Data Holder and press `Add Component` &rarr; `Replacement Actor`  

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/45fa471d-3b24-459c-b1bd-2664081ab514)

Click on the just added Replacement Actor and go to the details panel  
Under there you should see `Simple UGC` &rarr; `Actor Replacement`

Add `A_ItemDataHolder` to the Actor Classes to replace list

Lastly make sure that `Show Inherited Variables` is checked  

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/1c599ef7-ef5e-4474-a1a5-1baeb143aa86)

## Adding a new placeable

Start by right clicking on the mod folder again and adding a A_Placeable from the Blueprint Classes

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/aa98c667-2989-4666-9ece-4196adabddc6)

Open the new placeable and customize it to your liking  
You can for example change the model

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/809185e6-efc8-4b81-b1e4-6bc5bf922cba)  
![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/b58b6c49-364b-4c74-8784-d7977aef5a10)  
![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/51a93dba-a4ee-4c97-bb3a-d77f8f4781ac)

To change the default values select the root placeable

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/261319f1-9332-46f1-b2b7-78f0d24648ac)

If you want to edit the placement collision for example, you will need to check the `Make Custom Collision Check` box

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/7042cada-2df6-4853-b49f-878445450694)

After you are done with the placeable then it's time to add it to the Item Data Holder that we added earlier  

Go to the Item Data Holder and select the `AdditionalItems` variable

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/efd85c7c-3ffc-4c0d-b834-1f9504a3dcc2)

Now in the details panel you can add a new item under the Default Value section  

In this example I am changing the following:
1. `Name`
2. `Texture` which is the icon that shows in the inventory
3. `Category` which is placeable in this case
4. `SpawnedPlaceableReference` which is the actual placeable actor that we created

## Modifying a weapon

Start by going to your Item Data Holder and clicking the AdditionalItems variable

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/efd85c7c-3ffc-4c0d-b834-1f9504a3dcc2)

Add a new element to the array and change the values to your liking

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/4507b5bb-7849-4237-9b70-454e4cc01d38)

To make a weapon you will need the following
1. `Wearable` set to **true**
2. `Weapon` set to **true**
3. `Slot` set to **2**
4. `Category` set to **Equipment**

Inside WeaponStats you will find all weapon related values like the damage and fire rate

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/733c2db2-99dd-4d15-b7de-af43f1d51afe)

### Packaging the mod

Before the mod can be loaded with the game it needs to be packaged

To package your game just press `File` &rarr; `Package UGC`

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/fedb3a15-6af4-42e4-abe3-382044005345)

After the engine is done packaging you should get a packaged mod with a .pak file in there

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/b6b2b7e4-2340-4f94-b075-e68e90befab8)

Now you can just place the whole packaged mod folder inside your game's (and server's) mods folder and test it

### Uploading to the Steam Workshop

Uploading to the workshop is done through the workshop upload tool in game  
You can find the upload tool on the mods page in the settings

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/53ba7ce2-872e-4013-b21f-f9e246797868)

Now just fill in the information and copy paste the `Mod folder` path  
For the `Preview image` make sure that the image is less than **1MB** in size and in a **square format**  
The usual display size in the Steam Workshop is 200Ã—200 pixels

![image](https://github.com/Uuvana-Studios/longvinter-modding/assets/73204452/a52ea15e-ba2f-468a-b79c-69fdcde99b90)

After clicking the upload button the Mod will start uploading  
If the mod upload was successful you should get **OK** and the window should close  
If you get **LimitExceeded** it means that your preview image is too large
